title: Ziheng Liu - Ph.D. Student
---

I am a Ph.D. student at Kahlert School of Computing, the **University of Utah**, starting from 2022. I am advised by Professor [<em>Cem Yuksel</em>](http://www.cemyuksel.com/). Before that, I was managed by Professor [<em>Yin Yang</em>](https://yangzzzy.github.io/). My current research interest is physics-based simulation and motion capture. <br><br> I grew up in Shanghai, China, and received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Peking University, China in 2020. Before moving to the U of U and changing my research area to computer graphics in 2022 Fall, I was studying computer networks at Georgia Tech.
